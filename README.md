# Audio Vizualizer

## Overview
This a real-time audio visualizer. All the audio is generated in real-time, affecting the visualizer in real-time.

It's a work in progress that I'm displaying publicly to document the process.

It has two main components:

### Graphics Component
This component handles all the vizualization. I used [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) because it's very easy to use and has almost everything I needed. It's typically a framework for making games, but I figured it could also work for this.

### Audio Component
The audio is all generated by a synthesizer built in [Max](https://cycling74.com/). When a note is played, Max sends a message via OSC to the visualizer app. The visuals respond depending on the message.

It is generative music, but not AI generated. It's just plain old algorithmically generated music. Just as Brian Eno and God intended.


### Open Sound Control
OSC is a protocol that allows communication between electronic instruments and/or computers. It's basically super [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI).

The library I'm currently using for OSC is [oscpack](https://github.com/RossBencina/oscpack). I had to make some modifications to the library to get it to work on arm64 (I'm using an M1 mac). For this, I would like to thank [this unmerged PR](https://github.com/RossBencina/oscpack/pull/22). I took those fixes and manually implemented them.

### Isn't OpenGL Deprecated On Mac?
Yes it is. But I'm doing it anyway. There may (probably will) come a point where I want to go [turbo time](https://youtu.be/-ETF6rS8WWI?si=Gf3nYXfe7rStwJ9Z) on the graphics, but that time has not yet come.
